<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>

<p align="justify"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</a> at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). I am fortunate to be jointly advised by <a href="https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Zuo-Jun Max Shen</a> and <a href="https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Anil Aswani</a>. Prior to joining UCB, I received B.S. and M.S. degrees in <a href="https://ie.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering</a> at the Middle East Technical University.</p>

<p align="justify">I am thrilled to announce that, as of the 2024-25 academic year, I will be joining <a href="https://www.insead.edu/" target="_blank">INSEAD</a> as an Assistant Professor of Technology & Operations Management!</p> 

	<!--	
	<p align="justify"> You are welcome to meet me and explore my research at this year's <a href="https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/phoenix2023/" target="_blank">INFORMS Annual Meeting</a> in Phoenix, AZ, scheduled between October 15-18, 2023. During the event, I will be participating in the following two sessions: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Co-chair (with Max Shen) and Presenter in <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10856/session/1087" target="_blank">Responding Climate Crisis with Data-Driven OM</a>. <br>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
	
	<p align="justify">My research designs stochastic data-driven models and computational algorithms for <b>operations management</b> (OM) involving <b>strategic agents with information asymmetries</b>, which manifest by <b>limitations in data</b> that is shared between parties. This work revitalizes classical OM theory by drawing from a diverse spectrum of techniques in online sequential learning, statistics, artificial intelligence, optimization, and principal-agent theory.</p>

	<p align="justify">I am particularly interested in exploring applications in the domain of <b>(environmental) sustainability analytics</b>, where I specialize in formulating sustainable business operations that effectively mitigate the climate crisis. Moreover, my work holds wide practical relevance, extending to areas such as supply chain management and healthcare analytics. </p>
