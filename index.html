<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
	
	<p align="justify">My research designs stochastic data-driven models and computational algorithms for <b>operations management</b> (OM) involving <b>strategic agents with information asymmetries</b>, which manifest by <b>limitations in data</b> that is shared between parties. This work revitalizes classical OM theory by drawing from a diverse spectrum of techniques in online sequential learning, statistics, artificial intelligence, optimization, and principal-agent theory.</p>

	<p align="justify">I am particularly interested in exploring applications in the domain of <b>(environmental) sustainability analytics</b>, where I specialize in formulating sustainable business operations that effectively mitigate the climate crisis. Moreover, my work holds wide practical relevance, extending to areas such as supply chain management and healthcare analytics. </p>
